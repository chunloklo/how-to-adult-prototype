You’ve recently been hired for either an internship or a full-time position, probably as a software engineer. There is lots to unpack, especially on the financial side, as now you will have a steady flow of income that offers plenty of opportunity. In this section, we’ll be diving into what that entails, both for internships and full-time jobs. First, we’ll look at the ideal accounts required to build a healthy financial infrastructure. That will be followed by an approximate breakdown of your monthly income, followed by what specific things that money should funnel to. We’ll conclude with some common misconceptions people may have about finance as well as some additional resources that will enhance your understanding.</p>\n<h1>The Necessary Tools:</h1>\n<p>A good set of accounts to have for anyone, interning or working full-time, is a set consisting of a checking account, at least one savings account, and an investment account. Paired with a few credit cards, this will allow for a healthy financial infrastructure. To clarify, a checking account is basically an account that stores your money for you to use and pay off certain things, it is essentially your virtual wallet. A savings account is an account that stores funds for short and long term goals, and usually is not delved into to deal with daily expenses. These accounts also usually have high interest rates associated with them in order for your money to grow faster. An investment account is usually a platform that invests your money into multiple or even just one account that will be either set aside for retirement and long term financial growth. Credit cards are cards that are used to make immediate purchases in daily life, which accrue an interest-free debt that is paid off at the end of each month, building credit (if cards are not paid off at the end of each month, the debt becomes interest heavy, hurting you!). These are a necessity to have in order to build credit for big purchases later in life, and if you do not own a credit card as a college student, it is highly recommended that you obtain one. For those without a steady or sufficient income, which is most students, secured credit cards are a good option to start building credit, as they do not require a credit score or good credit in order for you to obtain one.</p>\n<p>These tools are all extremely important to building a healthy financial infrastructure that you can carry forward with you for the rest of your life. As an intern, certain practices discussed below will be different than as a full-time employee, but the tools above will provide the ability to have purchasing power and make efficient financial decisions at any point in your future. Even if all of these tools are unobtainable, don’t worry! Getting a good start on building a good financial infrastructure, no matter how small, is always better than doing nothing with the money you will be earning.</p>\n<p>Really Great Checking Accounts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/checking-accounts\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/checking-accounts</a></p>\n<p>Personal Favorite: Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking</p>\n<p>Really Great Savings Accounts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/savings-accounts?trk=nw_gn2_4.0\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/savings-accounts?trk=nw_gn2_4.0</a></p>\n<p>Personal Favorite: Capital One 360 Savings</p>\n<p>Best Credit Cards (choose the category most applicable to you, there is one for Students!):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/the-best-credit-cards?trk=nw_gn1_4.0\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/the-best-credit-cards?trk=nw_gn1_4.0</a></p>\n<p>For investment accounts, for the sake of this manual, we will be restricting information to discussing Roth IRAs and 401(k)s. There are a ton of investment options out there, and a good starting point is either or both of these accounts, depending on your employment type. The best practice for further investing is to do research on the many types of investment avenues available and to choose the one that best works for you and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Now that you are aware of the ideal tools needed, go ahead and set up accounts in each category that you are comfortable with. If you are a full time employee, chances are that you will be offered some sort of company-contributed investment account. Definitely open an account and make sure you take advantage of the free money that the company is willing to invest in your future.</p>\n<p>Once you have these tools ready for your use, the next step is to take a look at your internship or job income and break it down into healthy percentages of spending, saving, and investing, so that we can use these tools to funnel this income to the right places.</p>\n<h1>Income Breakdown:</h1>\n<p>The first good habit to get into before even thinking about what you will do with your money is calculating the tax rate that will be applied to your income, ensuring that you have a realistic idea of what money will actually be deposited into your account. A good tax calculator is linked below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes\">https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes</a></p>\n<p>You can select your state, income, and tax filing status. If you are an intern, extrapolate your income to what it would be for a full year’s worth of salary, and then get the after tax value and reduce it back down to the number of weeks you will be interning. This number you get at the end of using the calculator is the money that will be deposited into your account over the course of time applicable. Divide this value by 12 to get your approximate monthly income.</p>\n<p>For both types of employment, relocation stipends and bonuses will also be taxed at the same percentages.\nNow, the breakdown. There is a bunch of information out there about how your monthly income should be broken down, but a good rule of thumb to follow is explained in this graphic, with one important caveat:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/4a41d/budget.webp\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRn4AAABXRUJQVlA4IHIAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZACw7CB0JiE3OfQ/8AD5tZR1qkEjn/Np8IOpqBSj1YHJ59MelHojx4gL3QJrTCj4sVA7995nWr8U6Lbj1fVfv2a8OZO2U/ghc+uTaYOwUOsO/u5ChBxAAAA='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Budgeting Rule Pie Chart\"\n        title=\"Budgeting Rule Pie Chart\"\n        src=\"/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/5ca24/budget.webp\"\n        srcset=\"/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/cbe2e/budget.webp 148w,\n/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/3084c/budget.webp 295w,\n/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/5ca24/budget.webp 590w,\n/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/dad35/budget.webp 885w,\n/how-to-adult-prototype/static/6b07219fafa936184c14bb6401c5d911/4a41d/budget.webp 950w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>This graphic is mostly correct, with one missing detail. First, the savings category should be divided into two subcategories: savings goals and investments. Ideally, you want to put 10% of your income into retirement and other investments, while another 10% will go into short-term and long-term savings goals, such as tuition, a car, dining plans, etc. Other than that, the above pie chart paints a pretty accurate picture of how your income should be broken down.</p>\n<p>If you’re an intern, chances are a good bit of the needs are already taken care of. Food may be provided at the office (as is the case with many software companies nowadays). You may be given a relocation stipend or be placed in corporate housing. If this is the case, and your needs such as groceries and utilities don’t make up 50% of your income, more power to you! You can take the rest of that percentage and divide it into the other categories as you see fit! Save more money, or spend more of it, especially if your needs category does not demand as much from your income.</p>\n<p>One important principle to keep in mind that will aid greatly in the use of your income is the concept of using your income on needs, saving/investing, and wants, in that order. This concept is known as “paying yourself first”, and is a common term that is applied to many things, such as working out in the morning so that you are done with it before you begin the day. Using your income in this order allows for the important parts of living a sustainable life to be taken care of, such as paying your rent on time and saving money for tuition. After that, once your essentials are taken care of and you have fulfilled the truly important necessities, you can then use whatever money that is left over on wants! This greatly mitigates the issue of overspending or not sticking to a “budget.” If you can first take care of the necessities, there does not have to be a hard cap on what you spend on fun things, as all of your essentials have already been taken care of. This leads to healthier and guilt-free spending on things you truly love, such as a new video game or an expensive dinner at that restaurant you’ve always wanted to try.</p>\n<p>Breaking down your income as such organizes it as well as gives it purpose. This baseline will allow you to learn more about your own spending habits and changing needs. Feel free to tweak this plan as necessary, and if you are an intern returning to college, redistribute some of the percentages to work for yourself!</p>\n<p>The next step to discuss is where this money will specifically be funneled to. Yeah, you should be saving 10% of your money a month, but what exactly does that mean? Investing 10% of your income sounds fantastic, but which accounts are we putting this money into? It is important now to fully understand and interconnect your personal finance infrastructure.</p>\n<h1>Personal Financial System:</h1>\n<p>Now that you know what tools are needed in order to set up your financial infrastructure, as well as how you should ideally be splitting up your income, let us break down how to automate everything for your own convenience as well as where specifically the money should go. First, let’s start with the 401(k), one of the most important benefits your employer can offer you. If you are an intern, feel free to skip the next section, but keep in mind for when you do get full-time offers, 401(k) matches are an important benefit that most (if not all) companies offer.</p>\n<h2>401(k):</h2>\n<p>A 401(k) is a retirement account that your employer will most likely offer to you as part of your benefits. This is an account that you will not be able to open (without severe penalties) until you are 59 and ½ years old, but this is because this is a long-term retirement investment account that accrues money from your income <em>pre-taxes</em>. That last part is really important, as this means that you can put a significant amount of money into this account to accrue value before it is taxed. This leads to about 25% more money you can contribute to your 401(k) over your lifetime, so take advantage of this. Chances are that your employer will offer you a match up to a certain percentage of your income, and if it is possible, you should try and max this out! This is because if a company is matching your contribution, this is literally free, pre-tax money that is going towards your retirement and long-term financial stability. Hence, to the best of your ability, try and max out your 401(k) at your company, and this will be a great step towards your financial future that you won’t even see in your monthly income from above. It is automatically deducted from your paycheck each month, which means that you are essentially “paying yourself first” in order to invest that money before you can use it. Try and max out your 401(k), and then move on to the other steps below.</p>\n<h2>Paying off Needs/Fixed Costs:</h2>\n<p>Unless the world and life truly hates you, your rent and utilities every month will probably be a fixed cost. If you are an intern in corporate housing, this is already taken care of, but it is still a fixed amount that the company is paying to house you there. You want to make sure that the first thing you are doing when you receive your money each month is paying off these fixed costs and eliminating the headache of ever being behind on bills. Turn on auto-pay in your systems that demand a fixed cost each month, so that you know that you are paying off your bills immediately when your income comes in. This also gives you a more realistic picture of the money you have left to actually use for the rest of your expenses and desired spending, saving, and investing. Some fixed costs such as groceries can’t be set to “auto-pay”, but approximating the amount you need each month and making sure that remains in your account after the steps below should work well enough for needs that are not one-time payments.</p>\n<h2>Credit Card Bills!:</h2>\n<p>The next thing you want to do is to pay off all of your credit card “debt” accrued from the last month. The reason I put debt in quotes is because this is never real debt as long as you pay it off in full each month. Just to be crystal clear, if you want to avoid financial ruin, <em>pay off your credit card bills each month in FULL</em>. Otherwise, credit card companies will ding you with a nasty little term called APR, which for all things that matter in this situation just means <em>a whole ton of interest</em>. Any actual debt (note how it is not in quotes this time) that you carry over from a given month to the next will be hit with huge amounts of interest that will just add up over time. Pay it off in full and you don’t have to pay any interest on it, and you will build good credit, which will help for car loans, mortgages, and fun super adult stuff later on in life. Go to your credit card accounts and set up auto-pay each month in these from the checking account your income comes into (providing you are making enough for your spending), so that every month, your credit card will reach into your checking account and pay off your bill in full without you needing to worry. This will <em>further</em> reduce the money you have to spend on stuff in the coming month, but don’t worry, that is because it was taking care of your spending from last month. If interning, once your internship is over, assuming you now will have a finite amount of money left for the near future, turning off auto-pay might actually be a good idea in order to make sure that you have enough money every month to pay your bills off. I personally did this in college in order to ensure I was never overdrafting from my checking account.</p>\n<h2>Savings:</h2>\n<p>The next place that your money should go to should be all of your savings goals, whichever those may be. If you have a short-term savings goal for a car in 5 years, or tuition in 3 months, set aside money for that each month, and set up auto-withdrawal from your savings account to your checking account, so that the money is being saved without any extra hassle on your end. Use your savings goals and actively save each month. Once this is done (approximately 10% of your monthly income), we have one more step before you literally can spend the rest of your money on whatever you want.</p>\n<h2>Investments:</h2>\n<p>Remember the other 10% of the savings bucket that I said needed to be accounted for? This is for investments, retirement accounts and other accounts. The first investment that should have occurred as a full-time employee should have been before you were even paid, in the form of your 401(k). After that, one good practice is to invest in a Roth IRA, <em>whether you are an intern or a full-time employee</em>. You can open up a Roth IRA account in a lot of different places, with websites such as Vanguard or Fidelity being good options, but this is a very important account that should definitely be opened at a young age. A Roth Individual Retirement Account, or Roth IRA, is a retirement account that you deposit post-tax income into that will be invested and grown in order to be withdrawn at any age after 59 and a half (severe penalties if you withdraw before that age). The huge bonus of a Roth IRA is that when you withdraw money out of it once you retire, you will not be taxed on it, which means that you will keep all of the money that you have accrued on it. There is only a max contribution to the account each year of approximately $6,000, so regardless of if you are an intern or a full-time employee, opening one is in your best interests. Roth IRA’s are explained in this article below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp</a></p>\n<p>Besides this main investment vehicle, you can also invest your money in stocks, bonds, and a bunch of avenues that may or may not net you money depending on how the market performs. A good safe option to invest your money is to invest money into low-cost index funds that grow with the economy and are low-risk for the long term. Fidelity, Vanguard, and a bunch of places have low-cost index funds that have fairly low and competitive fees, so check those out for investing your money further. Remember, due to inflation, if you save your money, it usually will lose value over time, so the best thing you can do with your money for the long-term is to invest it.</p>\n<h2>Spending Time!:</h2>\n<p>Now that you have taken care of your present and future needs, the money you have left now is yours to spend. You don’t need to stick to a budget within the remaining money you have, because all of your important stuff is taken care of. This is the benefit of “paying yourself first.” You now can spend the money left in your account guilt-free, and on things you really want and desire, without worrying about penny pinching (given you have enough money). This allows for a better relationship with money and a sense of fulfillment when you are able to buy things that you have wanted because you have the leftover income to do so. Most of this spending will be done in the form of credit card spending, as spending on a credit card is a secure and efficient way to pay for things (as long as you are paying off your bills each month in full!).</p>\n<p>This is a basic summary of your financial system every month, with most of it being automated and hassle-free. This financial infrastructure will allow you to truly thrive while not worrying about fancy money terms that people will throw your way or get-rich-quick schemes. It is a boring but efficient and financially responsible system that will set you up for long-term success.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finances","date":"April 01, 2020","description":"Tips and Tricks for managing finances whether for your internship or your full-time job."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/financial/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/full-time/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Your First Full Time Job"}}}}}
